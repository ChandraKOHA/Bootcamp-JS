<h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am a child born in Indonesia in the 1990s who likes all things in the field of technology
                    and wants to become a programmer, I am a graduate of technology science with a specialization
                    in information systems. I started my career by working in a private company in the financial sector.
                    I worked in foreign currency exchange in Bali for 5 years (2013 - 2018) and my position was head of treasury.
                    While working at a money changer, I have a personal business in the field of selling computer hardware and
                    service which I have studied for 3 years (2017 - 2020), and now I am back working in a private company in the
                    field of foreign currency exchange and my position is a data processing staff (2019 - Now). And right now I'm trying to
                    cross majors to what I love and dream of, which is to become a programmer or data scientist.</p>
